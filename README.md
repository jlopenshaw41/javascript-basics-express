This is a web API created using Express. It takes a series of [basic JavaScript functions](https://github.com/jlopenshaw41/javascript-basics), created at the beginning of the bootcamp course, and makes them accessible to other applications via a web API.

This is a project completed as part of the Software Engineering FastTrack course at Manchester Codes.
